- 🔭 I’m currently working on combining deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with traditional tree <br/>
search algorithms to find optimal training environment modifications (RL Design) for improved <br/>
agent evaluation performance.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about end-to-end memory networks based on RNN architecture, linear programming, <br/>
and various policy gradient reinforcement learning algorithms. 
- 💬 Ask me about anything! Always happy to learn new things and meet likeminded individuals.
